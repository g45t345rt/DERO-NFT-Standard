# DERO NFT Standards

Two types of NFT standards with each their own strength.  
Choose one that best fits your need.  

## G45-NFT

A real private/public DERO NFT Asset Token.  
The SCID is the NFT token unique hash and the balance represent prints/supply usually 1.  
This NFT Standard uses multiple Smart Contracts to match NFT within a collection.  

## T345-NFT

This NFT Standard uses one Smart Contract for the entire NFT Collection.  
The NFT unique id is the SCID() + index number. It is not a real asset token.
