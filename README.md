# DERO NFT Standards

Two types of NFT standards with each their own pros/cons.  
Choose one that best fits your need.  

## G45-AT

A real private/public DERO Asset Token.  
The SCID is the token unique hash and the balance represent owners/prints/supply usually 1 for a NFT.  
The Standard uses multiple Smart Contracts to match nfts within a collection.  

## T345-NFT

This NFT Standard uses one Smart Contract for the entire NFT Collection.  
The NFT unique id is the SCID() + index number. It is not a real asset token.
